## Hey there! 👋

My name is Kian, and I'm a recent graduate from the MSc Robotics at the Delft University of Technology. I don't have the most impressive GitHub page to share, but we all have to start somewhere :). 

- The most important projects I've worked on are highlighted in the "pinned" section. Other repositories are simple course assignments.
- I'm currently catching back up on Python basics, as well as a little bit of C++.

(This ReadMe is written in October 2025, ask me again in a year what projects I've gotten up to 🤓)
